## Machine_Learning & Deep_Learning_Practice

### Storm Prediction 
* Storm Prediction as a binary classification 
* Artificial Neural Network
* Heatmap of wind, temperature, reflectivity, and relative vorticity data
* Based on ams-ml-python-course at Github

### Classification Problem: Churn rate prediction
* Encoding categorical data
* Split the data into the training and test set
* Feature Scaling
* Building ANN and predict the Churn rate of the bank customers

### Regression Problem: Solar Radiation prediction
* Heatmap and scatter plots of weather features (temperature, pressure,solar radiation, etc.)
* Linear regression, Random Forest, Support Vector, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and ANN
* Evaluations of different regression models

### Advanced house price prediction: Kaggle competition
* EDA - Heatmap, boxplot, and scatter plot
* Missing values and outliers
* Random Forest Regression model with GridSearchCV.
