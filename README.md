# Machine_Learning & Deep_Learning_Practice

I am learning and practicing ML & DL and would like to post my notebooks here.

* Random Forest Regression model: EDA of house price, predict the house price with GridSearchCV
      I have studied several Kaggle notebooks and practiced based on their coding:

* Artificial Neural Network model: predict the Churn rate of the bank
* XGBoost model: predict the house price in Melbourne
